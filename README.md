## A bot that will give you free pringles, poorly coded in Python using Selenium and AntiCaptcha. If Steve Cahillane sees this, expect this repository to go down. If this bot surprisingly worked for you, it would be cool if you [donated](https://en.liberapay.com/bestadam/) to me. It would convince me to code better and actually be more commited to these projects (cause who doesn't like money???).

Basically what this bot does is it:
- Opens up the [Pringles promo site](https://pringlessweepstakes.com).
- Generates random info using your catchall.
- Auto solves the captcha (the system is a little slow and you will need to get credits on the [AntiCaptcha site](http://getcaptchasolution.com/wfgri4goqd)).
- Instantly goes to the reward screen and repeats the whole process.

## NOTES: 
This bot is very bad and will eventually fail due to either unknown reasons or AntiCaptcha being too slow, make sure to check up on it at least once an hour.

When initially starting the bot, make sure to close out the tab that asks for you to accept cookies. If you don't the bot will fail.

You will **NOT** win every time when using this bot, be patient.

The Pringle links will go to your email/catchall.

You are free to modify the code in any way you want, but if you do PLEASE make a PR.

## UPCOMING FEATURES:
NOTE: I probably won't implement these unless this promotion gets extended or revived (after the end of it). If you want to see the latest planned features/progress on them, go to the Issues tab and sort by the tag [enhancement](https://github.com/bestadamdagoat/pringles-bot/labels/enhancement). 

- Auto Accept Cookies
- Re-enter using the same generated account
- Make the script into an Executable and configure it using a config file
- Use different captcha system
